French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday it was not his place to pass judgment on the decision by Charlie Hebdo to publish a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammad. Macron, speaking during a visit to Lebanon, said it was important for French citizens to be respectful to each other, and avoid a "Dialogue of hate" but he would not criticize the satirical magazine's decision to republish the cartoon.
Macron's remarks came as Charlie Hebdo, the target of a massacre by Islamist gunmen in 2015, said Tuesday it was republishing the controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed to mark this week's start of the trial of alleged accomplices in the attack.
Macron extolled the virtues of democracy and freedom of speech as he said: "It's never the place of a president of the Republic to pass judgment on the editorial choice of a journalist or newsroom, never. Because we have freedom of the press."
